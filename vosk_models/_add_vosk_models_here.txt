# Vosk Speech Recognition Models

This directory should contain Vosk speech recognition models for voice recognition functionality.

## Download Vosk Models

Download Vosk models from the official website:

https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models

## Recommended Models

For English speech recognition, we recommend:

- **vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15** (40 MB) - Lightweight model

For other languages, check the Vosk models page for available options.

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the desired model(s) from the link above
2. Extract the downloaded archive (usually a .zip file)
3. Place the extracted folder(s) directly in this `vosk_models` directory

Example structure:
```
vosk_models/
├── _add_vosk_models_here.txt (this file)
├── vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15/
│   ├── am/
│   ├── conf/
│   ├── graph/
│   └── ivector/
└── vosk-model-en-us-0.22/
    ├── am/
    ├── conf/
    ├── graph/
    └── ivector/
```

## Usage

After downloading and extracting models, run the voice recognition integration test:

```bash
python tests/test_voice_recognition_integration.py
```

The test application will automatically detect all available models and allow you to select which one to use.

## Model Selection

- **Small models** (~40 MB): Fast, lower accuracy, good for testing and development
- **Medium models** (~100-300 MB): Balanced speed and accuracy
- **Large models** (1-2 GB): Best accuracy, slower processing

Choose based on your accuracy requirements and available system resources.
