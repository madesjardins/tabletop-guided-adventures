# Camera Calibration Images

This directory should contain camera calibration images for testing the calibration module.

## Download Calibration Images

Download all calibration images from the following Google Drive folder:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hNMYz9KV5h4m3BCLkFu0OBJlWMcWAwb7?usp=drive_link

## Required Files

Place all files from the Google Drive folder into this `tests/images` directory. The calibration test expects the following images:

- `calibration_top.jpg` - Top view of the checkerboard
- `calibration_front.jpg` - Front view of the checkerboard
- `calibration_side.jpg` - Side view of the checkerboard

## Checkerboard Specifications

The default checkerboard configuration is:
- Width: 23 squares
- Height: 18 squares
- Internal corners detected: 22 x 17 = 374 corners

## Usage

After downloading the images, run the calibration integration test:

```bash
python tests/test_camera_calibration_integration.py
```

This will detect corners in all three views and perform full camera calibration.
