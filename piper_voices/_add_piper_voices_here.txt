# How to Download Piper Voices

This folder contains Piper TTS voice models. Voice models are not included in the repository
due to their large file size.

## Downloading Voices

### Method 1: Using Python (Recommended)

You can download voices directly in the current directory using the piper-tts Python package:

```bash
cd piper_voices
python -m piper.download_voices en_US-lessac-medium
```

Replace `en_US-lessac-medium` with your desired voice name.

### Method 2: Manual Download

1. Visit the Piper voices repository:
   https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/main

2. Navigate to the language and voice you want (e.g., `en/en_US/lessac/medium/`)

3. Download BOTH files for each voice:
   - `*.onnx` - The voice model file
   - `*.onnx.json` - The voice configuration file

4. Save both files in this `piper_voices` folder

## Available Voices

Browse all available voices at:

You can listen to samples of each voice before downloading.

## Example Voice Names

- en_US-lessac-medium
- en_GB-cori-medium
- en_US-amy-medium
- en_US-danny-low
- And many more in various languages!

## Requirements

Each voice requires TWO files with the same base name:
- `voice_name.onnx`
- `voice_name.onnx.json`

Both files must be present in this folder for the voice to work with the test scripts.
